# Senders Distribution list
This query analyzes email events to generate a distribution of external senders who have sent emails to a specific recipient. It filters emails based on the domain of the sender (excluding internal organization emails) and the specified recipient email address. The results are then summarized by sender address and visualized in a pie chart.

This query is valuable for identifying potential external threats or anomalies in email traffic. By focusing on external senders and their volume of communication, security analysts can detect unusual or suspicious patterns, such as a high number of emails from unexpected sources or domains. This helps in identifying potential phishing attacks or other malicious activities targeting specific recipients in the organization.
