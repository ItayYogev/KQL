# Cloud App Events by User or Device
This query retrieves cloud application events from the CloudAppEvents table, filtered by a specific user or device. It captures key information such as the event timestamp, user account, action type, application used, IP address, associated resources, and file hashes (SHA256).

This query is highly valuable for security analysis as it helps detect suspicious or unusual activity tied to specific users or devices.
