# Search Process OR SHA256 In Organization
This query searches for specific processes or their associated SHA256 hash values within the organization by analyzing events recorded in the DeviceProcessEvents table. It allows users to input a particular process name, SHA256 hash, or a file name, filtering the results to include relevant events.

This query is crucial for security monitoring and incident investigation. By identifying processes of interest, analysts can detect unauthorized or suspicious activities related to specific software. The ability to track processes based on file names and SHA256 hashes enhances the capability to correlate events across different devices and user accounts.
