# Who has local admin
This query identifies local admin accounts on devices by analyzing logon events from the DeviceLogonEvents table.

 By identifying who has local admin privileges, security analysts can:
 - Understand the distribution of local admin rights across devices.
 - Track changes in local admin accounts over time.
 - Help in implementing the principle of least privilege by identifying accounts that may no longer need local admin rights.
