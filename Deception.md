# Deception

Deception is a feature in **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE)**, similar to a honeypot. There are three main options:

1. **Decoys**: Fake assets, such as specific users or computers.
2. **Lures**: All the fake findings that lead attackers to the decoys. This can include credentials or fake network diagrams that we will embed on the organization's computers.
3. **Deployment and Management**: The deployment of decoys and lures through MDE. The implementation will vary between organizations based on the machine learning analysis conducted on the organization, which helps determine the best places to embed them.

## Creating a New Deception Rule:
First, we need to ensure that the Deception feature is enabled. To do this, go to **Settings** > **Endpoints** > **Advanced Features** and toggle on the deception button.

Now, click on the "Add Deception Rule" button and fill in the following details:

- **Rule Name**: The name of the rule.
- **Description**: A description of the rule.
- **Lure Types**:
  - **Basic**: Embedding documents into decoys.
  - **Advanced**: The decoys are integrated within the entire Active Directory environment. The attacker, using Red Team tools, will be able to locate them, making it difficult to distinguish between real and fake accounts.

You can also select both options.

- **Define Rule Scope**: 
  - **All Windows Client Devices**: Across the entire environment.
  - **Devices with Specific Tags**: On specific devices.

- **Manage Decoy Accounts and Hosts**: A list of all fake decoys, which can be manually edited.

- **Lures**: Two options are available:
  - **Use Autogenerated Lures**: Lures that will be created automatically.
  - **Use Custom Lures Only**: Manually create a lure.

- **Summary**: A summary of what has been configured across all pages.
