# User Deleted

This query is designed to monitor and detect instances of user account deletions within a defined timeframe. The deletion of user accounts can be a precursor to malicious activities, such as insider threats or unauthorized access attempts. By monitoring for such events in near real-time, security teams can quickly identify and respond to potential threats before they escalate into larger security incidents.

Identifying who initiated the deletion provides an accountability mechanism.
