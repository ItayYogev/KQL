# User Created
This query retrieves recent events related to user account creation from the DeviceEvents table. This detection rule is critical for identifying potential unauthorized user account creation, which could indicate a security breach or malicious activity within an organization's network.

By monitoring for new user accounts, security teams can quickly investigate suspicious activity, such as accounts created without proper authorization or during odd hours, which could signal compromised credentials or insider threats.
