# IP Matched With CTI Feed
This query detects potentially malicious network activities by comparing remote IP addresses from device network events with a list of known command and control (C2) IP addresses sourced from a cyber threat intelligence (CTI) feed. 

This detection rule is crucial for enhancing an organization's threat detection capabilities. By utilizing a CTI feed, it leverages real-time intelligence about known malicious IP addresses, allowing security teams to identify and respond to potential threats swiftly. By continuously monitoring for connections to known malicious IPs, organizations can identify potential command and control communications before they escalate into serious security incidents.
