The "detection rules" KQL folder is designed to centralize and organize queries that are used to identify and analyze potential security threats within the organization. This folder contains a collection of KQL queries tailored to detect various types of malicious activity and anomalies across different data sources. By consolidating these detection rules, the folder enhances the organization's ability to monitor, identify, and respond to potential security incidents effectively, improving overall threat detection and response capabilities.
