# AWS Assume Role In Production
This query is specifically designed to monitor AWS AssumeRole actions occurring within designated production accounts by utilizing data from the CloudAppEvents table. The creation of automated detection rules like this is essential for maintaining continuous visibility and security over critical environments, such as production.
