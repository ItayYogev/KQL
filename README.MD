# KQL:
The KQL folder is a folder I created as part of my day-to-day tasks to improve the security posture of organizations. The queries are tailored for the Microsoft Defender XDR platform.

By leveraging KQL, these queries automate threat detection processes. They can be customized to meet specific organizational security needs, and the detection rules help identify threats before they cause significant damage.
There are more queries that I want to recommend in the 'stars' category on my profile.

The queries and tools within the SOC Analysis Kit enable teams to streamline the incident response process by providing ready-to-use resources for analyzing breaches.
