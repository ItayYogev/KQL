The "vulnerability management" folder is specifically designed to present a comprehensive view of all existing OS vulnerabilities within the organization. By concentrating exclusively on OS vulnerabilities, the folder allows for the precise tailoring of queries to exclude non-relevant data, ensuring that the focus remains solely on operating system-related issues.

The folder includes various queries that provide insights into OS vulnerabilities from multiple perspectives, such as their age, distribution across different devices, types, and severity levels. This structured approach helps in identifying and understanding vulnerabilities in detail, supporting more effective management, prioritization, and remediation of security risks associated with the organization's operating systems.
