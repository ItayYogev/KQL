# CVE Count by Severity Level
The CVE Count by Severity Level query analyzes software vulnerabilities by categorizing them based on their severity levelsâ€”Medium, High, Critical, and Low. By categorizing CVEs by severity, security teams can quickly identify the proportion of high and critical vulnerabilities that pose the most significant risk to the organization, allowing for prioritized response efforts.

This overview enables organizations to assess their security posture more effectively, fostering informed decision-making about risk management and mitigation plans.
