# Vulnerabilities Count per Software
The Vulnerabilities Count per Software query provides an analysis of software vulnerabilities by counting the number of unique Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) associated with each software application.  By visualizing the count of vulnerabilities for each software application, security teams can quickly identify which software poses the highest risk due to the number of associated vulnerabilities.

Understanding which software has the most vulnerabilities allows organizations to prioritize their patch management and remediation strategies, ensuring that high-risk software is addressed promptly.
